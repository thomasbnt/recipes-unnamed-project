## Cooking Tips for Main Courses

### Protein Preparation
- **Marinating**: Allow at least 30 minutes for flavors to penetrate
- **Room temperature**: Let proteins come to room temperature before cooking
- **Resting**: Allow cooked meats to rest for better texture

### Flavor Building
- **Season in layers**: Salt and season throughout the cooking process
- **Fresh herbs**: Add at the end for bright, fresh flavors
- **Acid balance**: A splash of lemon or vinegar brightens heavy dishes

### Timing Your Meal
- **Start with longest cooking items**: Begin with grains, roasted vegetables
- **Prep mise en place**: Have all ingredients ready before you start
- **Keep it warm**: Use low oven or warming drawer for finished components
