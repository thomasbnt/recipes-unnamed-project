### What is Gluten?
Gluten is a protein found in:
- **Wheat** (including spelt, kamut, farro, and durum)
- **Barley** (including malt extract and malt flavoring)
- **Rye** (including triticale)
- **Brewer's yeast** (unless specifically gluten-free)

### Hidden Sources of Gluten
Watch out for gluten in:
- **Soy sauce** (use tamari instead)
- **Oats** (choose certified gluten-free)
- **Processed foods** (check labels carefully)
- **Seasonings and spice blends**
- **Medications and supplements**

## Gluten-Free Pantry Essentials

### Alternative Flours
- **Almond flour**: Great for baking, adds protein
- **Rice flour**: Neutral flavor, good for coating
- **Coconut flour**: High fiber, absorbs lots of liquid
- **Tapioca starch**: Excellent for binding and texture
- **Potato starch**: Adds moisture to baked goods

### Whole Grains
- **Quinoa**: Complete protein, versatile
- **Brown rice**: Classic staple grain
- **Millet**: Mild flavor, good for porridge
- **Amaranth**: High protein, nutty flavor
- **Buckwheat**: Despite the name, it's gluten-free

### Binding Agents
- **Xanthan gum**: Helps replace gluten's binding properties
- **Guar gum**: Alternative to xanthan gum
- **Psyllium husk**: Natural fiber, great for bread
- **Chia seeds**: Natural binding when mixed with liquid
- **Flax meal**: Adds omega-3s and binding power

## Cooking Tips

### Avoiding Cross-Contamination
- **Separate cutting boards**: Use dedicated gluten-free boards
- **Clean surfaces**: Thoroughly clean all prep areas
- **Separate toaster**: Use a dedicated gluten-free toaster
- **Check labels**: Always read ingredient lists
- **Dedicated utensils**: Consider separate cooking tools

### Baking Success
- **Measure carefully**: Gluten-free flours behave differently
- **Add binding agents**: Use xanthan or guar gum as needed
- **Don't overmix**: Can make baked goods gummy
- **Let batters rest**: Allows flours to hydrate properly
- **Use room temperature ingredients**: Improves mixing

## Nutritional Considerations

### Getting Enough Fiber
Many gluten-free products are lower in fiber:
- **Choose whole grains**: Brown rice over white rice
- **Add vegetables**: Increase fiber naturally
- **Include legumes**: Beans and lentils are fiber-rich
- **Eat fruits**: Natural fiber and nutrients

### B Vitamins
Wheat products are often fortified with B vitamins:
- **Fortified gluten-free products**: Look for enriched options
- **Leafy greens**: Natural source of folate
- **Nutritional yeast**: B-vitamin powerhouse
- **Consider supplements**: Consult with healthcare provider

## Dining Out Tips

### Questions to Ask
- **Preparation methods**: How is food prepared?
- **Cross-contamination**: Are there dedicated fryers?
- **Ingredients**: What's in sauces and seasonings?
- **Staff knowledge**: Are servers trained on gluten-free options?

### Safe Choices
- **Grilled proteins**: Simple preparations
- **Salads**: With oil and vinegar dressing
- **Rice dishes**: Verify no soy sauce or wheat
- **Naturally gluten-free cuisines**: Mexican, Indian, Thai (with modifications)

## Recipe Modifications

### Common Substitutions

- **Wheat pasta** = Rice, corn, or legume pasta
- **Breadcrumbs** = Gluten-free breadcrumbs or ground nuts

Instead of wheat flour for thickening:

- **Tapioca starch**: Excellent for fruit fillings
